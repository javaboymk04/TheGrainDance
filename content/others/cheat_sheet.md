## TL;DR

HP5 is forgiving, contrasty in a nice way, and makes my Pentax MX feel like a tiny tank.  
Grainy? Yes. Ugly? Not at all.

---

## Gear & setup

- **Camera:** Pentax MX  
- **Lens:** SMC Pentax 50mm f/1.4  
- **Film:** Ilford HP5 shot at EI 400  
- **Developer:** Whatever your lab used this time 😅  

### Sample frame

## Shooting experience

I loaded HP5 on a very grey afternoon in Jakarta.  
The first thing I noticed was how **forgiving** the exposure latitude felt.

- Shadows hold a surprising amount of detail.
- Highlights clip more gracefully than I expected.
- Metering with the MX’s centre-weighted meter was totally fine.

## Grain & look

I actually like the grain here. It’s visible, but not crunchy.

- At **35mm**, the grain gives street shots a bit of texture.
- Faces still look soft and flattering, not sandpapered.
- Scans from my lab were easy to tweak with very minor contrast adjustments.

## Verdict

If I had to sum it up:

1. **Beginner-friendly:** easy to expose, hard to truly ruin.
2. **Flexible:** looks good from EI 200–1600 if you know what you’re doing.
3. **Not too precious:** you don’t feel guilty burning through a roll.

Would I shoot HP5 again?  
**Absolutely.** Probably as my default “everyday walk” film for a while.

Thanks for reading — if you’ve tried HP5 (or pushed it to 1600+),  
I’d love to hear how it went for you.
